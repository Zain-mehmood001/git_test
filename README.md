# Hi. This is me starting fire ship course on Git & Github

A Git repo keeps track of all the changes made to any files within the that repo where .git exists

We use "git --init" to initialize a Git repository

It is hidden. you can show it in VScode and maybe other softwares.

If you ever want to remove Git then remove the git repogit(.git/) folder
