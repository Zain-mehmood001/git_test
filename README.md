# Hi. This is me starting fire ship course on Git & Github

A git repo keeps track of all the changes made to any files within the that repo where .git exists

we use "git --init" to initialize a git repository

it is hidden. you can show it in VScode and maybe other softwares.

if you ever want to remove git then remove the git repogit(.git/) folder
